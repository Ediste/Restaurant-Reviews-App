# Restaurant-Reviews-App

This project is part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree

# Instructions

## Description
* In this Project i converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. The given static design that lacks accessibility was converted to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use
* To convert the application to a Progressive Web Application - that load like regular web pages but offer the user a offline experience - i added a Service Worker

## How to start
Simply open the following url: https://ediste.github.io/Restaurant-Reviews-App/ 

OR 

Clone the repo and start a local http server
* You can use python to start a simple http server
* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
* Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
* With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000
